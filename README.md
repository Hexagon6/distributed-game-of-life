##Benchmark of calculations
of game of life

```
10 workes
vs 100times x 2xrecalculate x 100xpartsOfWolrd
1: 6617ms
1: 5957ms
1: 5870ms
```

```
1 worker (single thread)
vs 100times x 2xrecalculate x 100xpartsOfWolrd
1: 22223ms
1: 23846ms
1: 24604ms
```

## speedup
generally on 4 actual cores one can expect speedup of 3.9 times


#HOW

you know the `drill`

```
    git clone
    cd
    npm install
    node index.js
```
